Streamlined Zuend Machine Cutting and Engraving out of Rhino V5
ZORG converts Curves and translates them into Zuend-HPGL, then 
streams the Data directly to the Zuend-Cutter.
The Script is meant to be started from Rhino Command-Line but can
also be assigned to an Icon.

Prerequisites:
The Script is depending on pyserial http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyserial/ to send commands to the Zuend-Machine.
Make sure you copy the serial folder of the unpacked pyserial to the same directory where the ZORG script resides.
->   Rhinoscriptfolder|serial
                      |ZORG_V1_0.py

To create a Rhino Command Line Alias:
-Open Tools|Options|Aliases from the Rhino Menu
-Press "New" to create a new Alias
-Enter a name for the Alias. We prefer to use ZORG as command-name ;)
-Enter the following as Command Macro:  ! _-RunPythonScript "FilePath\ScriptFileName"
-It should look like this: ! _-RunPythonScript "C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\scripts\ZORG_V1_0.py"

Using the variable definitions it is possible to customize the default Workspace Area and Cutting Speeds/Depths
Use the sendToMachine Variable-Option to save to a local file instead of sending the Data directly to the Zuend-Cutter

The script does some basic error-handling:
-Only Curves will be selectable
-A Bounding Box is used to check if all selected Curves are in the Workspace Area
